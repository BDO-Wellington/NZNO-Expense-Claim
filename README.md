## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BDO-Wellington/NZNO-Expense-Claim.git
cd NZNO-Expense-Claim/NZNO-Expense-Claim
```

### 2. Configure the Application

Copy the template and edit `config.json` to set your API endpoint and options:

```bash
cp config.template.json config.json
```

Edit `config.json`:

```json
{
  "SUBMIT_INDIVIDUAL_LINE_ITEMS": false,
  "API_URL": "https://your-api-endpoint.com/submit",
  "DEBUG_MODE": "PRODUCTION"
}
```

**Configuration Options:**
- `SUBMIT_INDIVIDUAL_LINE_ITEMS`: `true` to submit each expense item separately, `false` to submit all as one payload
- `API_URL`: Your backend API endpoint (Power Automate, Zapier, custom server, etc.)
- `DEBUG_MODE`: `"DEBUG"` to hide PDF download button, `"PRODUCTION"` for normal operation

### 3. Deploy

#### Option A: GitHub Pages (Recommended)

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Go to **Settings** > **Pages**
3. Select **Deploy from a branch** > **main** > **/ (root)**
4. Your site will be available at `https://[username].github.io/[repo-name]/`

#### Option B: Local Development

You need a local web server (not just opening the HTML file due to ES6 modules):

**Quick Start Scripts (Recommended):**

Windows:
```cmd
start-server.bat
```

Mac/Linux:
```bash
chmod +x start-server.sh
./start-server.sh
```

**Manual Start:**

```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js
npx http-server -p 8000

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your browser.

#### Option C: Other Hosting

Upload all files to any static hosting service:
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Azure Static Web Apps
- AWS S3 + CloudFront
- Cloudflare Pages

**Note**: ES6 modules require proper MIME types, so ensure your hosting serves `.js` files as `application/javascript`.

## Usage

### Filling Out the Form

1. **Enter Personal Details**:
   - Full Name (required)
   - Employee ID (required)
   - Expense Claim Date (required, defaults to today)

2. **Standard Expenses**:
   - Enter amounts for applicable expense types
   - Attach receipts/documents for each expense
   - Use arrow keys or click to change values (scroll wheel is disabled)

3. **Private Vehicle**:
   - Enter kilometres driven
   - Amount is automatically calculated at $1.04/km
   - Add optional comment/description

4. **Other Expenses**:
   - Click "Add Other Expense" to add custom expense items
   - Enter description, amount, and attach files
   - Click "Remove" to delete unwanted rows

5. **Submit**:
   - Click "Submit Claim" to send to the configured API
   - Or click "Download as PDF" to save locally

## Recent Improvements

### Modularization (October 2025)
-  Refactored from single-file to modular architecture
-  Implemented ES6 modules for better code organization
-  Separated concerns: UI, business logic, PDF generation
-  Improved testability and maintainability

### UI Enhancements
-  Disabled scroll wheel on number inputs to prevent accidental changes
-  Improved print-friendly styling
-  Fixed page break issues in PDF generation
-  Enhanced form validation and error messaging

### PDF Improvements
-  Optimized page break placement
-  Prevented unwanted breaks after headings
-  Reduced top margins for better layout
-  Added explicit page break control

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with ES6 module support
- Local web server (Python, Node.js, or PHP)
- Text editor or IDE

### Testing
To test the application locally:

1. Start the local server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. Open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your browser

3. Test all features:
   - Form filling and validation
   - Dynamic row addition/removal
   - File attachments
   - PDF generation
   - Form submission

### Browser Console
Open developer tools (F12) to view:
- Configuration loading messages
- PDF library validation
- Module initialization logs
- Error messages and debugging info

## Security Considerations

###  Important Security Notes

1. **Do NOT put sensitive secrets in `config.json`**:
   - API keys, passwords, or tokens should never be in frontend code
   - Use a backend proxy to handle authentication
   - Or use secured API endpoints (e.g., Power Automate with authentication)

2. **API_URL is visible to users**:
   - Anyone can see your API endpoint in the browser
   - Ensure your backend validates and authenticates requests
   - Rate-limit your API to prevent abuse

3. **GitHub Pages is public**:
   - All code and config is publicly visible
   - Don't include any sensitive information
   - Use environment-specific configs for different deployments

4. **File Upload Security**:
   - Backend should validate file types and sizes
   - Scan uploads for malware
   - Store files securely with appropriate access controls

## Browser Compatibility

-  Chrome 90+ (Recommended)
-  Firefox 88+
-  Safari 14+
-  Edge 90+

**Note**: ES6 modules require modern browser support. For older browsers, consider using a bundler like Webpack or Vite.

## Troubleshooting

### Configuration Not Loading
- Ensure `config.json` exists and is valid JSON
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify web server is serving JSON with correct MIME type

### PDF Not Generating
- Check browser console for library loading errors
- Ensure html2pdf and jsPDF libraries are loading from CDN
- Try clearing browser cache and reloading

### Form Not Submitting
- Verify API_URL in `config.json` is correct
- Check browser console for network errors
- Ensure backend endpoint is accessible and accepting requests
- Check CORS settings on backend

### ES6 Module Errors
- Ensure you're accessing via HTTP (not file://)
- Verify web server is serving .js files with correct MIME type
- Check for typos in import paths

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] Unit tests with Vitest/Jest
- [ ] TypeScript conversion

### Might Do
- [ ] Mobile app wrapper
